            <h3>My Professional Experience</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Software Engineering Intern @ Shopify</h4>
                <p>
                    I have been working as a backend software engineer at 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shopify/">Shopify</a> since May 2022. 
                    During my time at Shopify, I have contributed to the development of 
                    Shopify's official deploy coordinator Shipit Next which
                    ships thousands of code changes daily across all services at Shopify.

                <h4>Software Developer Co-op @ Telus Communications</h4>
                <p>
                    I worked as a backend software developer at 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/telus/">Telus Communications</a> for 8 months in 2021.
                    During my time here, I developed and deployed key microservices to enable network operations teams
                    to simulate and model the Telus network.

                <h4>Research Assistant @ University of Alberta</h4>
                <p>
                    My first professional experience was working as a research assistant at 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-alberta/">University of Alberta</a> in 2020.
                    During my 3 months of working there, I participated in a research project about brain-muscle connectivity.
                    I undertook all coding related activities for the project and automated the process of performing
                    key statistical analyses for the experiments.
